Program Committee Chair Manual
==============================

Assemble the Team
-----------------

The first task as program committee chairs is the assembly of the rest of the
program committee.  This consists of two groups, the mini-symposium chairs and
the abstract reviewers.

Mini-symposium chairs should be recruited as soon as possible.  The
mini-symposium address scientific python in a domain-specific sub-community. It
is the mini-symposium chair's role to encourage participation from their
community, select talks for the session, and organize the content of the
session.  The content and organization of the session is left up to the
discretion of the mini-symposium chair.  In the past, they have consisted of a
series of talks, panel discussion, "state of the community", or a combination of
the above.  Since a large amount of growth of the conference comes from
the recruitment in these sub-domains, it is important to get the mini-symposium
chair engaged early on.

The duties of reviewers on the program committee are not as extensive as the
mini-symposium chairs, but they are very important.  A large number of reviewers
are required to address the increasing number of submissions.  The number of
reviewers to be recruited can be computed as::

  r = s * 3 / (10  * (1 - a))

where r is the number of people to recruit as reviewers, s is the expected
number of submissions, and a is the expected attrition rate.  Each submission
should have three reviews, and ten reviews is a reasonable expectation from a
reviewer.  The attrition rate depends on the set of reviewers -- it is
approximately 0.3.

Track and Conference Theme Selection
------------------------------------

In the past the conference has been divided into one General track and
two tracks related to the main themes of the conference.  The themes should be
selected based on feedback from the community and the interests of the chairs.
Good themes are related to "what's hot", have broad appeal, and have a strong
Python community.  The mini-symposium themes are determined by the
domain those willing to serve as mini-syposium chairs.  Four to five
mini-symposia have been held per-conference in the past.

Decide on a Calendar Dates
--------------------------

Adequate time needs to be given for program deadlines.  Working from the start
of the conference backwards:

* At least two months should be allowed before the conference starts to when the
  speaker and poster schedule is announced.  The schedule attracts people to the
  conference and allows attendees to plan their attendance.
  ae.

* Approximately two weeks before the schedule announcements, the deadline for
  reviews should be planned to allow the PC chairs time to create the schedule.

* Approximately three weeks prior, the abstracts should be distributed to
  reviewers to give them sufficient time to review.

* Two weeks prior, the deadline for abstracts submissions should be place.  This
  allows a week for a deadline extension and a week to sort abstracts to
  distribute to reviewers.

* Approximately three months prior, the call for conference abstracts should be
  made to give submitters sufficient time to prepare their abstract.


Preparation of the Call for Abstracts
-------------------------------------

The call for abstracts should be reviewed by the conference chairs,
communitation chairs, and the proceedings chairs.  The call for abstracts should
contain:

* A general description of the conference.

* The main themes of the conference.

* The domain-specific mini-symposia themes.

* Deadline dates.

* Links to previous years websites.

* Formatting and content requirements.

* Selection process and rubric description.


The Conference Abstract Selection Process
-----------------------------------------

Conference abstracts are scored by the reviewers with criteria on a 1-10 scale.
The abstracts are ranked by an overall score created by combining the
normalized, weighted scores from all reviewers.  After the mini-symposium chairs
have selected the submissions they would like to use in their session, the talk schedule is filled
with the highest rank scores provided the submission desired a talk.  Special
circumstances, such a balance between tracks, more than one talk by the same
author, and the comments by the reviewers are only taken into account one the
schedule starts to fill up.  Posters are similarly selected from the ranked
scores.

Abstract Decision Emails
-------------------------

Decision emails to all submitters should contain:

* Author names.

* Title.

* Talk/poster/rejection decision.

* Instructions with talk duration and poster size.

* Reminder that all attendees must register.

* Proceedings instructions.

* A notification that more slots may open up.

* A request for confirmation of attendance.

Then, attendance needs to be tracked, and the schedule adjusted accordingly.
