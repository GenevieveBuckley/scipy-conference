SciPy Data Policy
==================

SciPy Conference attendees and others interested in the conference share their contact information with us (members of the SciPy Conference organizing committee), in particular their email addresses, so that we can communicate with them about the conference. Also, attendees leave more detailed contact information with us when they register for the conference through the website. We do not store credit card information, but we do store other contact and attendance information in the website backend database.

Access to this information is provided to members of the SciPy Conference organizing committee so that we can organize and run the conference. In the course of doing this, we need to be careful with the contact information and limit access to it. For those of us that have access, this Data Access Policy document should govern how we treat the contact data.

The SciPy Conference has a privacy policy that explains to attendees and contacts how we will handle their contact information. A copy is included below, “Information We Collect and How It’s Used”.

To help ensure we treat the information we gather in the manner laid out in the conference privacy policy below, we will limit access to the data to those that need to access it to do their jobs. In general this will include the conference co-chairs, the communication committee co-chairs, program committee co-chairs, and members of the technical committee. Everyone with access shall read this document and agree to abide by its terms.

As the legal entity backing the SciPy Conference, Enthought, Inc. is ultimately responsible for ensuring that we all meet our obligations with respect to data privacy laws worldwide. Thank you for your help in making sure the SciPy Conference organizers and Enthought meet our obligations and do right by the SciPy community.
