SciPy 2014 Birds of a Feather Sessions (BoFs) - Call for Submissions
====================================================================

SciPy 2014, the thirteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python
conference, will be held this July 6th-12th in Austin, Texas. SciPy
is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing
through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and
engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from
academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase their
latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and
collaborate on code development.

SciPy has plenty of opportunities to get together and discuss primary,
tangential, or unrelated topics in an interactive, discussion setting.

In an effort to increase the opportunities for community building, SciPy would
like to emphasize the use of birds of a feather (BoFs) sessions.  These
sessions usually include short presentations by a panel and a moderator with
the bulk of the time spent opening up the discussion to everyone in
attendance. We will organize a number of BoFs that are of general interest
such as state-of-the-project and BoFs based on the themes of the conference
and the mini-symposia topics.

Some example past BoFs include Reproducibility, Teaching Scientific Computing
with Python, The Future of Array Oriented Programming, PyNE Updates, Python
and Finance, NumFOCUS, Python in Astronomy, SciPy 2013, Collaborating and
Contributing in Open Science, and the Matplotlib Enhancement Proposal
Discussion.

We would like to solicit the community for ideas and organizers for other BoF
topics. Please include a small description of the BoF, possible panelists, and
whether you would be willing to moderate.

To suggest a Birds-of-a-Feather session, fill out a brief description in the

Register, go to the *Dashboard*, then *Submit a new proposal*.

A preliminary schedule will be determined Friday, June 13th, with additions
as possible.
