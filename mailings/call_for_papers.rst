Dear SciPy 2014 presenter,

Congratulations on having your talk accepted for this year's event--we look
forward to hearing your presentation!  As in the past, SciPy2014 will
release a conference proceedings, and you are invited to contribute a
full-length paper (up to 8 pages) expanding on your abstract.

The proceedings are aimed at highlighting significant contributions to
scientific computing in Python, such as:

* new software packages that support the Scientific Python Stack
* domain-specific applications of Python in any field of research
* significant improvements to existing software packages
* hardware systems designed to support the Python stack
* scientific computing in education

Papers should be submitted as pull requests by **June 15th**, but modifications
are allowed during the open review period which ends **July 5th**.  During this
time, members from the program committee and the scientific Python community at
large may provide feedback, which should be addressed through discussion on
GitHub and by updating the pull request.

The SciPy 2014 Proceedings Chairs
